The steps you're outlining involve installing Git on Ubuntu using the official Git PPA (Personal Package Archive) repository to ensure you're getting the latest stable version. Here's a breakdown of the commands you're using and what they do:

1. **Check the current release of Ubuntu:**
   ```bash
   cat /etc/*release
   ```
   This command shows the version and distribution of your Ubuntu system.

2. **Check the installed version of Git:**
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```
   This will display the version of Git currently installed on your system.

3. **Remove any existing Git installation (if needed):**
   ```bash
   apt purge git -y
   ```
   This will remove the Git package and its configuration files from your system.

4. **Verify that Git is uninstalled:**
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```
   This will now show an error message if Git has been successfully uninstalled.

5. **Add the official Git PPA to your system:**
   ```bash
   add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
   ```
   This adds the PPA (Personal Package Archive) for the latest stable version of Git to your system's repository list.

6. **Update the package list to include the PPA's information:**
   ```bash
   apt update
   ```
   This ensures that your system is aware of the new repository and can fetch the latest packages from it.

7. **Install Git from the added PPA:**
   ```bash
   apt install git
   ```
   This installs Git from the repository you've just added.

8. **Verify the newly installed version of Git:**
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```
   Finally, this will display the version of Git that was just installed, which should now be the latest available from the PPA.

### Full Process Example:
```bash
# 1. Check the Ubuntu release version
cat /etc/*release

# 2. Check the installed Git version
git --version

# 3. Remove Git if installed
apt purge git -y

# 4. Verify Git is removed
git --version

# 5. Add the Git PPA repository
add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa

# 6. Update the package list
apt update

# 7. Install Git from the PPA
apt install git

# 8. Verify the newly installed Git version
git --version
```

### Explanation of Each Step:
- **`cat /etc/*release`**: Checks your Ubuntu distribution and version. It’s useful for knowing which version of Ubuntu you're running, as this might affect which Git version is available in your default repository.
  
- **`apt purge git -y`**: Purges the Git package. The `-y` flag automatically confirms the removal.

- **`add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa`**: Adds the official Git PPA. This ensures you're getting the latest stable version of Git directly from the Git project’s maintainers.

- **`apt update`**: This updates the package index so your system is aware of the latest available packages from all repositories, including the newly added Git PPA.

- **`apt install git`**: Installs the latest version of Git available from the PPA.
