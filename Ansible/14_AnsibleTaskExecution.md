In Ansible, the tasks within a playbook are executed sequentially, following the order in which they are defined. Ansible operates in a task-based model, where each task is executed one after the other on the target hosts.

Here's an example to demonstrate the sequential execution of tasks in an Ansible playbook:

```yaml

---
- name: Example Playbook
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Task 1
      debug:
        msg: "This is Task 1"

    - name: Task 2
      debug:
        msg: "This is Task 2"

    - name: Task 3
      debug:
        msg: "This is Task 3"
```

In this playbook, there are three tasks defined: Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3. When you run this playbook using ansible-playbook, Ansible will execute these tasks in the specified order.

The execution sequence will be as follows:

1. Ansible will connect to the target hosts defined in the hosts section.
2. Task 1 will be executed on all target hosts. It will print the debug message "This is Task 1".
3. Once Task 1 completes on all hosts, Task 2 will be executed. It will print the debug message "This is Task 2".
4. Finally, Task 3 will be executed, printing the debug message "This is Task 3".

The tasks are executed sequentially, meaning that Ansible moves to the next task only after the previous one completes (or fails).

It's important to note that Ansible is designed to be idempotent, meaning running the playbook multiple times should result in the same outcome. If a task has already been executed and the playbook is rerun, Ansible will skip that task unless something has changed in the environment that affects its execution.

By defining the tasks in the playbook in the desired order, you can control the sequential execution of tasks according to your requirements.
